ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Java

Simple

Easy to learn, especially if you know C/C++.

No complex concepts like pointers or multiple inheritance (handled with interfaces).

Object-Oriented

Everything in Java is based on objects and classes.

Principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

Platform Independent (WORA â€“ Write Once, Run Anywhere)

Java code is compiled into bytecode which runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

Works on any platform (Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.) without modification.

Secure

No explicit pointers â†’ less memory corruption.

JVM provides sandboxing and runtime security checks.

Supports features like bytecode verification and access modifiers.

Robust

Strong memory management (automatic garbage collection).

Exception handling helps in writing error-free programs.

Multithreaded

Built-in support for multithreading.

Allows concurrent execution of tasks for better CPU utilization.

Distributed

Java provides APIs like RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and CORBA to build distributed applications.

High Performance (compared to other interpreted languages)

Uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, which compiles bytecode to native machine code at runtime.

Dynamic

Supports dynamic loading of classes.

Can adapt to evolving environments.

Portable

Bytecode can run on any system that has a JVM.

No platform-specific implementations.
